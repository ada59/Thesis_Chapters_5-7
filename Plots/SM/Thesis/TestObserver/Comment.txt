Some of the species measured by me are in the extremes of their genus group, but looking at the measurements they seem ok (E.g. Gila specimens and Moxostoma austrinum).
I'll leave as they are in Final Revised, and proceed with the analysis with these values.
Remember that the "previous" plots are generated with the Additional residual scripts and objects.
